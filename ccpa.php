                      to visitors, users, and others who reside in California (“consumers” or

                      sending request on this contact@premiuminsurancepolicy.com</a>. Non-California residents do not have
                      such rights under the CCPA. We may ask you to provide us with additional
                      information to verify your request and we will also ask you to confirm the

                      calendar year, request information about our disclosures of certain
                      categories of personal information to third parties for direct marketing
                      purposes. To be valid, requests must be submitted to us at
                      privacy@premiuminsurancepolicy.com. Within thirty days of receiving an
                      authenticated request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal
                      information disclosed for direct marketing purposes during the immediately
                      preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of the third

                      Consistent with the “What Information We Collect” and “How We Use the
                      Information We Collect” sections in the <a href="/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a> on this site, we
                      collect certain categories and specific pieces of information about
                      individuals that are considered “personal information” under applicable
                      California statutes. Under the CCPA, “personal information” is information
                      that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with a
                      particular California resident or household. As detailed in the <a href="/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a>,
                       we may collect this personal information from you and other third
                      parties. We collect, share, and disclose personal information for business
                      and commercial purposes as described in the “What Information We Collect,”
                      the “How We Use the Information We Collect” and the “When We Share or Sell
                      The Information We Collect” sections of this site’s <a href="/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a>.

                  <p>
                      Subject to certain exceptions, as a California resident, you have the right
                      to: (i) access your personal information; (ii) obtain the deletion of your
                      personal information; (iii) opt-out of the sale of your personal
                      information; and (iv) receive information about the categories of personal
                      information about you that we have “sold” (as that term is defined under
                      California law) to third parties and also that we have disclosed for
                      business purposes. To exercise these rights, as noted above, on this website or contact us at
                      privacy@premiuminsurancepolicy.com. We may ask you to provide us with
                      additional information to verify your request.

                      Do Not Sell My Personal Information. Some of our sharing activities may be
                      considered a “sale” of personal information under California law. This
                      includes when we share information collected from cookies and similar
                      tracking technologies (such as how you interact with our Sites and our
                      Third-Party Partners’ websites) with our Third-Party Partners and
                      third-party service providers in order to present Third-Party Partners’
                      products and services to you and relevant advertising messages based on
                      your preferences and other information we have collected from you. Subject
                      to certain exceptions, as a California resident, you may opt-out of the
                      sharing of your personal information we collect through our Sites and web
                      forms through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies by
                      changing your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
                      before accepting cookies to opt-out of the collection and sharing of your
                      information.

                  <p>
                      Keep in mind that, if you opt out of the collection and use of information
                      via cookies and other tracking technologies, you may still see advertising
                      that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be
                      less relevant to you. Please also note that you will need to make such
                      choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Sites. Also, in
                      the event that you request the deletion of your personal information, some
                      of that information will be retained in our database, solely to comply with
                      all applicable laws and regulations.

                      We may change or update this California Privacy Rights disclosure from time
