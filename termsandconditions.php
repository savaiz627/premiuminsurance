                      wherever arising, that may result from your use of the Service, including
                      without limitation to losses incurred due to: (a) any losses, injuries, or

                      of the Service. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL

                  <p>
                      The Company is not responsible for examining or evaluating the business
                      practices, actions, omissions, or services of marketing affiliates whose
                      products are featured on this Site. IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU
                      AND A MARKETING AFFILIATE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
                      LAW, YOU RELEASE THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS,
                      DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM AND AGAINST
                      CLAIMS AND DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND
                      UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
                      CONNECTED WITH SUCH A DISPUTE.

                  <p>
                      If you are a California resident, by using the Service, you explicitly
                      waive the rights granted to you under California Civil Code 1542, which
                      states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
                      does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
                      release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his
                      settlement with the debtor." If you are a New Jersey resident, certain
                      sections of these Terms and Conditions, including Sections 5, 6, and 7 may
                      not apply to you pursuant to the New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract,
                      Warranty, and Notice Act. Additional states may not allow this exclusion or
                      limitation of liability, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply
                      to you.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                      YOU AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY AND ITS
                      OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, LICENSORS, AND SERVICE
                      OR CONTENT PROVIDERS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES,
                      EXPENSES, DAMAGES AND COSTS, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
                      COURT COSTS, ARISING OR RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND ANY
                      VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU CAUSE A TECHNICAL DISRUPTION OF THE
                      SITE OR THE SYSTEMS TRANSMITTING THE SITE TO YOU OR OTHERS, YOU AGREE TO BE
                      RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES, EXPENSES, DAMAGES AND
                      COSTS, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COURT COSTS, ARISING

                      9. <strong><u>Choice of Law; Forum</u></strong>. This document shall be
                      governed in all respects by the laws of the United States and the State of
                      Colorado, regardless of conflict of law rules. Any claim or dispute you may
                      have against us, whether subject to mandatory arbitration or otherwise,
                      must be brought in Denver, Colorado, except that arbitration proceedings
                      may be conducted by telephone. For any matters not subject to mandatory
                      arbitration, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts
                      located within the County of Denver, Colorado for the purpose of litigating
                      all such claims or disputes. All claims filed or brought contrary to this
                      section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim
                      improperly, we may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs,
                      provided that we have notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim
                      and you have failed to withdraw the claim promptly.
