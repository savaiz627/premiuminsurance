                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong><u>Section A. What Information We Collect</u></strong>
                      <strong><u></u></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      There are three primary ways we collect information about you: (1) when you
                      give it to us, (2) through automated technologies, and (3) by asking others
                      for it. We’ve broken down each of those three categories in further
                      detail below.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>1. Information You Provide to Us</strong>
                      <strong></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      First, you may provide information to us in various ways, such as through
                      forms or other means offered through our Services. The most likely way
                      you’ll provide us with information about yourself is by entering it
                      in our web form in order to have us connect you to a service professional
                      that will help you meet your needs. For example, we will ask you some basic
                      questions about your medical history in order to generate a health
                      insurance quote for you. The types of information you provide us fit into
                      two categories. Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is
                      information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address,
                      email address, or phone number. Non-Personal Information is information
                      about you or your household that, on its own, doesn't identify you
                      personally, like your gender, income or what types of products you're
                      interested in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      When we combine information that isn't Personal Information (like Usage
                      Information, as explained below) with Personal Information, we treat it
                      like Personal Information for as long as it is combined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>2. Information We Automatically Collect</strong>
                      <strong></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Second, we automatically collect certain information about how you access
                      and interact with our Services. We call this “Usage
                      Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Usage Information
                      is a critical part of how we improve your experience on our websites and,
                      more importantly, provide you with more personalized recommendations of
                      service providers. We may use various technologies to collect and store
                      Usage Information in connection your use of our Services. These may include
                      things like cookies, browser storage, web beacons, heat maps, mouse
                      tracking, and similar technologies. There are four types of Usage
                      Information we may collect:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Device Information. We collect information about your device, such as your
                      operating system, application or browser type and version, and unique
                      identifiers associated with your device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Log Information. We automatically collect certain information in system
                      logs or similar files about how you interact with our Services, such as
                      which buttons you click on. This Log Information may also include things
                      like your IP address, browser or device configuration, date and time of
                      access and cookie information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Information Used to Reidentify. We collect information in order to
                      reidentify you across multiple browsing sessions and devices (for instance,
                      connecting your current browsing with a prior session in which you provided
                      us your name).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Location Information. We may use certain information like your IP address
                      or other Device Information or Log Information to estimate your location.
                      We may also request to use location-enabled services on your device (which
                      typically provide GPS or Wi-Fi access point details) to enhance our
                      Services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We, or other parties we do business with, may place or recognize unique
                      cookies or other technologies on your browser when you visit our Services

                      Third, to provide you with more personalized product recommendations, we
                      collect information about you from third parties and from other sources,
                      such as publicly available databases, providers of demographic information,
                      and social media platforms. For example, we may collect information from a
                      third party to verify the address you provided or to help us understand
                      your occupational background.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We need to collect personal information to provide services to you. If you
                      do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide the

                      to us or to our partners in connection with our provision of Services, you
                      represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the
                      information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

                      <strong><u>Section B. How We Use the Information We Collect</u></strong>
                      <strong><u></u></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                      Services, like provide you with a referral to a service provider,

                      to provide the Services to you in a personalized way. Insurance and other
                      professional services products are complex and we therefore do not take a
                      one-size-fits-all approach to helping you find the right products. The
                      information we collect enables us to do this by giving us a more detailed
                      picture of who you are.
                  </p>

                      real time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      To communicate with you. Part of providing personalized services is quickly
                      connecting you with real people who can help walk you through your services
                      options. Therefore we use the information you provide to contact you about
                      the quotes or other product recommendations you requested through our

                      consent to being contacted by us, we will likely have one of our service
                      partners call you to follow up on your inquiry. We may also text and email
                      you information about how to contact us, specific offers, and other

                      In order to help connect you with insurance and other professional services
                      providers, we work with a number of partners to deliver the Services and
                      therefore share information with those partners. Also, we sometimes may -
                      with your express permission - sell the information you provide to third
                      parties to help better meet your needs. The following is a list of how we
                      share and/or sell your information in connection with your use of our
                      Services:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Share information with our partners (e.g., insurance carriers, insurance
                      agents, home improvement services providers, etc.) to provide and improve
                      our Services. We may share information about you with the third-party
                      partners we collaborate with to provide you the Services you requested. For
                      example, we work closely with certain insurance services companies to
                      provide our customers with personalized insurance quotes. When you request
                      a quote, we may therefore share your information with the carriers to
                      generate the quote for you. Or we may call you and redirect your call
                      directly to agents of one of those carriers to walk you through your
                      options. Or we may redirect you to the website of one of those partners and
                      pre-populate your information there to help seamlessly satisfy your
                      financial services inquiry.

                  <p>
                      Share information with service providers acting on our behalf. We may share
                      information about you with service providers we use to have them perform on
                      our behalf any of the activities we are permitted to conduct under this
                      Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. For example, we may share your
                      information with our data-provider partners to enable them to provide us
                      with further information about you, so that we can further personalize your
                      experience and service recommendations. Or we may share with third parties
                      deidentified or aggregated data that we collect, such as deidentified
                      demographic information, or information about the computer or device from
                      which you access the Service. We share such information for a variety of
                      purposes, including to monitor and understand Service usage, and improve
                      our own products and features.

                  <p>
                      Sell information to third-party providers with your permission. Where we
                      think others can offer you helpful products, after obtaining your
                      permission, we may sell your information to third parties who will try to
                      meet your needs. These third parties may be other insurance agencies,
                      insurance carriers, home services providers, or other entities that
                      facilitate the process of connecting customers with service providers.

                      about you to a third party as part of, or in preparation for, a change of

                      In accordance with California’s “Shine the Light” law (California Civil Code Section 1798.83) California residents may, no more than once per calendar year, request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

                      current industry standards. We strive to take appropriate security measures
                      to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
                      disclosure or destruction of your PII.

                      • We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable,
                      accurate, complete and current. We encrypt all PII, in order to prevent
                      unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted
                      to us. We also only keep collected information only for as long as
                      reasonably necessary and use it only for the purposes for which it was
                      collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or
                      document retention requirements.

                      We seek to use reasonable administrative, technical and physical
